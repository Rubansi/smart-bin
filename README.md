3. **Authentication System**
    → Prompt Gemini to generate auth flows (UI + Supabase backend code).
4. **UI/UX Wireframes**
    → Generate UI screens one by one (sign up, scheduler, payments, dashboard).
5. **Payment Integration**
    → Ask Gemini to generate payment flow with chosen gateway.
6. **Notifications**
    → Prompt for push notifications & scheduled reminders.
7. **Admin Dashboard**
